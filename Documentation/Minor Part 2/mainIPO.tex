The main function of a vision based soil analyzer is evident from its name. It performs an analysis of soil, by capturing and digitizing the reflected light of soil particles. This functionality is shown below in an Input-Process-Output\index{Input-Process-Output} (IPO) diagram, see figure \ref{mainIPO}. This is a so called black approach. It shows the input, a process and a output. At this stage it isn't relevant to know what happens in this process.
