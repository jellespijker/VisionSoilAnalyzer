This project finds its roots in the minor Embedded Vision Design (EVD) taught at the university of applied sciences HAN. During this minor a portable embedded device was developed which analyses soil samples using a microscope. This Vision Soil Analyser hereafter referred to as VSA, analyses soil samples using the optical properties. Itâ€™s main function is: Presenting quantifiable information to a user on the properties of soil: such as colour, texture and structure.

The VSA takes a snapshot from a soil sample, which is placed under a microscope in an closed environment. This digital image is analysed using a multitude of computer vision algorithms. Statistical data is presented to the user in the form a Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and a histogram of the shape classification. The PSD is obtained by calculating the number of pixels for each individual particle, whilst shape classification is determined by describing the contour of each individual particle as mathematical function which undergoes a transformation to the frequency domain. This complex vector then serves as input for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where the output classifies each particle in a certain category.

The prototype developed during the minor EVD will serve as a basis for a graduation project of that same student, which initialized the project. This is done for his main course mechanical engineering at the HAN. This graduation project is done under the auspices of MTI Holland. The goal during this second stage is to develop a field ready prototype. In conjunction with the necessary documentation (Technical Dossier). 
Due to the scale of the project, several key problems are identified and separated from the main project. These problems can be tackled by separated student groups.
