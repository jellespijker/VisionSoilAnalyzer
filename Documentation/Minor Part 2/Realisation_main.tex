This chapter describes the used vision processing techniques. The current prototype and work flow is developed to allow for different routines. The user has multiple options and strategies available to achieve optimum results. Each of these are explained in the sequential subsection below. It begins with the acquisition of image(s), which are then enhanced to allow for optimal segmentation of pixels related to sand particles. These pixels are used to determine the features of each particle, which serve as input for the classification algorithms.
