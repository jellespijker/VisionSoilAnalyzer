	abstract = {Labeling of connected components in a binary image is one of the most fundamental operations in pattern recognition: labeling is required whenever a computer needs to recognize objects (connected components) in a binary image. This paper presents a fast two-scan algorithm for labeling of connected components in binary images. We propose an efficient procedure for assigning provisional labels to object pixels and checking label equivalence. Our algorithm is very simple in principle, easy to implement, and suitable for hardware and parallel implementation. We show the correctness of our algorithm, analyze its complexity, and compare it with other labeling algorithms. Experimental results demonstrated that our algorithm is superior to conventional labeling algorithms.},

	abstract = {High-resolution digital soil mapping for applications like precision agriculture requires the collection of good-quality high spatial resolution information. Conventional soil analysis is expensive, time consuming and laborious. The development of proximal soil sensors to lessen the need for or to complement conventional soil analysis is important. Although proximal sensing may produce results that are not as accurate as conventional laboratory analysis, they allow for the collection of larger amounts of data using simpler, cheaper and less laborious techniques. This forms the rationale for proximal soil sensing. This article deals with indirect measurements of soil organic carbon ({OC}) and iron (Fe) contents using soil colour as the proxy. Measurements of soil colour were made using a digital camera. The {RGB} tristimuli were transformed to variables from other colour space models and a redness index ({RI}) and these were used to derive pedotransfer functions for soil {OC} and Fe. Predictions using univariate as well as full factorial regressions ({FFR}) of these tristimuli were compared to predictions using visible–near infrared (vis–{NIR}: 400–1100 nm) spectra with partial least squares regression ({PLSR}) and a reduced number of wavelengths selected using the variable importance for projection ({VIP}) with {PLSR} ({VIP}-{PLSR}). For predictions of soil {OC} content, the {VIP}-{PLSR} technique produced predictions with R2adj. and {RMSE} values of 0.91 and 0.46\%. These were only very slightly better than predictions by an {FFR} of the {CIELa}*b* tristimuli (R2adj. of 0.91 and an {RMSE} of 0.48\%) and {PLSR} (R2adj. of 0.91 and an {RMSE} of 0.50\%). Predictions using the logarithmic regression of the {CIEv}* variable were least accurate with R2adj. and {RMSE} values of 0.88 and 0.56\%. For predictions of Fe, an {FFR} of the {CIELc}*h* tristimuli produced an R2adj. of 0.71 and an {RMSE} of 0.068\%, which was better than those obtained by {PLSR} (R2adj. values of 0.64 and {RMSE} 0.074\%) and {VIP}-{PLSR} (R2adj. of 0.64 and 0.075\%). Predictions of Fe using the logarithmic regression of the {RI} produced the least accurate results with R2adj. and {RMSE} values of 0.56 and 0.081\%. In this study, we showed that a digital camera can be used for fast, accurate and non-destructive measurements of soil colour and predictions of soil {OC} and Fe contents in Brittany, France.},
