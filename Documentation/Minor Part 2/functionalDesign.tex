The functional design lays at the heart of a product. This is an abstract representation of the device. This chapter will illustrate the working of a vision based soil analyzer. It explains the main functionality and output with an Input-Process-Output (IPO) diagram. This will aid in determining specification and setting up a user interface, which in turn dictates the interaction with the outside world.
