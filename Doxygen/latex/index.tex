The Soil Analyzer is a portable lab that can analyse soil samples and tells the user about it\textquotesingle{}s optical properties. It looks at the texture and describe it as a Particle Size Distribution. This information is presented as a Cumulative Distribution Function (C\+D\+F). It also describes the structure of the soil sample and gives information on the sphericity and roundness / angularity. It does so by analysing the contour of particles, describing them as Fourier Descriptors and using a Neural Network to describe it\textquotesingle{}s properties. Finally it gives the color properties in a histogram in the C\+I\+E La$\ast$b$\ast$ colorspace, which show correlations with the fertility of the soil. and a histogram of the Redness Index, which gives has a correlation on the iron content.
